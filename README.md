##By Chengrui (Charlie) Zheng, Pengcheng (Steven) Xu, Hao Long, Robert Malongo

We retrieved dataset that contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial Pacific from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/el-nino-dataset/data#). Each buoy recorded important data points such as date, latitude, longitude, zonal winds, meridional winds, relative humidity, air temperature, sea surface temperature, and subsurface temperatures. Data from some buoys start from as early as 1980. This data can be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world, such as droughts and floods. In particular, we can use this data to understand and predict climate change patterns in the equatorial Pacific, and we did the data analysis by using R
